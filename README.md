# Merlin's Apprentice

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=flat-square&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)

Inspired by an obsesion with the BBC 2008 TV Series Merlin, this terminal based game was built to demonstrate my OOP abilities. Users must traverse Merlin's castle, collect items and defeat enemies using a simple combination of terminal commands.

## How to Use
Once you have cloned this repo, navigate to the game's folder in your terminal.

1. Compile the game's Java files with `javac *.java`

3. Follow instructions on the screen. Type `help` to be reminded of your options and objective, `quit` to exit the game
